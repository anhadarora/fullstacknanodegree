# Leafer's Health Items

Leafer's Health Items provides a list of items within a variety of categories and provides a user registration and authentication system. Registered users (anyone with a Facebook or Google account) have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items. Created by [Marie Leaf](https://twitter.com/mleafer), for Project 3 of Udacity's Fullstack Nanodegree.

<!--How to run-->
<!--This simple web application uses GitHub for authorization and authentication. To simulate security best practices, the API keys are not in the main application file or hard-coded. However, to facilitate grading, a shell script, export_keys.sh, is available to export API keys (current as of the time of submission) to server environment variables.-->
<!--This repository contains the mooc-catalog submodule, provisioned as catalog. The more updated and application-only code (no vagrant configuration) can be found at the mooc-catalog repository.-->

<!--To spin this website up:-->
<!--Download or clone the p3/vagrant directory.-->
<!--Initialize the Vagrant vm via vagrant up, which should set up on localhost:5000.-->
<!--Connect to the virtual machine: vagrant ssh.-->
<!--(Optional) Obtain your own GitHub API keys by registering a new application. Ensure you add localhost:5000/github-callback as the authorization callback URL.-->
<!--(Optional) Inside the virtual machine, export your own API keys, GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET.-->
<!--Navigate to the catalog directory: cd /vagrant/catalog-->
<!--(Optional) Run the provided key export shell script: source ../export_keys.sh.-->
<!--Start the server: python application.py.-->
<!--Navigate to it in your browser of choice at localhost:5000. The first-time run of the server will initialize the database with fixture data.-->
